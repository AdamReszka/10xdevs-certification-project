# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: SprintFlow

Sprint anomaly detector for tech leads — reads GitHub and Jira data to surface workflow anomalies ranked by sprint-delivery risk. Full spec: @context/foundation/prd.md

## Commands

```
npm run dev     # dev server at localhost:3000
npm run build   # production build
npm run lint    # ESLint flat config (eslint.config.mjs); no --fix flag exposed
```

## Architecture

- **Next.js 16.2.6 App Router** — use server components by default; do not use Pages Router
- **TypeScript 5 strict mode** — path alias `@/*` → `./src/*`
- **Tailwind CSS 4** + PostCSS (no UI component library yet)
- **Deployment target: Cloudflare Workers** — do not suggest Vercel-specific APIs or config; adapter is `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (not the deprecated `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`)
- No test framework installed yet — add one before implementing business logic
- No CI workflows yet (`.github/workflows/` is empty)

## Security constraints (non-negotiable)

- GitHub PAT and Jira API tokens must be encrypted at rest, never logged, never in client payloads
- No per-developer performance framing — all anomalies are team/sprint-level
- Graceful degradation: show last cached state + error banner on API failure

## Planned integrations (not yet installed)

These are required by the PRD but not wired yet:
- Auth: NextAuth or Better Auth (FR-001, email + password)
- Database: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM via Neon or Supabase
- AI: `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, model `claude-haiku-4-5` (FR-020, Refinement Helper only)
- Email: Resend (FR-018, Daily Recap)
- Background jobs: node-cron or Cloudflare Cron Triggers (15-min sync loops)
- Cloudflare adapter: `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (Workers target; `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` is deprecated)
- Database driver: `@neondatabase/serverless` with `drizzle-orm/neon-http` (Workers require HTTP mode, not TCP)

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 1

Move from sprint-zero setup to project orchestration with the **roadmap chain**:

```
(Module 1 foundation docs) -> /10x-roadmap -> backlog-ready roadmap items
```

`/10x-roadmap` is the lesson focus. `/10x-new` is intentionally introduced in Module 2, Lesson 2, when a selected roadmap item becomes an implementation change folder.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Roadmap (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-roadmap` | You have `context/foundation/prd.md` and a scaffolded project baseline, and you need a vertical-first MVP roadmap. The skill reads the PRD, inspects the code baseline, uses available foundation docs such as `tech-stack.md`, `infrastructure.md`, and `deploy-plan.md`, then writes `context/foundation/roadmap.md`. Use it BEFORE creating per-change folders or implementation plans. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-agents-md` / `/10x-infra-research` | Bundled from Module 1 so foundation contracts can be fixed before roadmap sequencing. If roadmap generation exposes a PRD gap, repair the PRD before pretending the backlog is ready. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-roadmap` bridges product and implementation. It does not choose frameworks, design schemas, or write a per-change implementation plan.
- The output is `context/foundation/roadmap.md`: ordered milestones, vertical slices, bounded foundations, dependencies, unknowns, risk, and backlog handoff fields.
- Roadmap items should receive stable human-readable identifiers in backlog tools. The actual `context/changes/<change-id>/` folder is created in Lesson 2 with `/10x-new`.

### Roadmap boundaries

- Default to vertical slices: user-visible outcomes that cross UI, data, business logic, and integrations.
- Horizontal work is allowed only as a bounded enabler that names the downstream vertical milestone it unlocks.
- Avoid orphan horizontal work such as "build the whole database", "build all API endpoints", or "design the whole UI" before the first user-visible flow.
- Roadmap is not a calendar estimate. Do not invent dates, story points, or sprint velocity unless the user explicitly asks for a separate planning artifact.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` - input
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` - optional input
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
