# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: SprintFlow

Sprint anomaly detector for tech leads — reads GitHub and Jira data to surface workflow anomalies ranked by sprint-delivery risk. Full spec: @context/foundation/prd.md

## Commands

```
npm run dev     # dev server at localhost:3000
npm run build   # production build
npm run lint    # ESLint flat config (eslint.config.mjs); no --fix flag exposed
```

## Architecture

- **Next.js 16.2.6 App Router** — use server components by default; do not use Pages Router
- **TypeScript 5 strict mode** — path alias `@/*` → `./src/*`
- **Tailwind CSS 4** + **shadcn/ui** (new-york style, neutral base, OKLCH tokens) — all UI must be built with shadcn/ui components; use the `@shadcn` MCP server to look up available components before implementing any UI surface; add components with `npx shadcn add <name>`
- **Component architecture: atomic design** — `src/components/ui/` (shadcn-generated primitives), `atoms/` (custom stateless primitives), `molecules/` (composite widgets), `organisms/{anomaly,dashboard,auth,setup}/` (feature sections), `templates/` (page-level shells), `providers/` (React context wrappers)
- **Deployment target: Cloudflare Workers** — do not suggest Vercel-specific APIs or config; adapter is `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (not the deprecated `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`)
- No test framework installed yet — add one before implementing business logic
- No CI workflows yet (`.github/workflows/` is empty)

## Security constraints (non-negotiable)

- GitHub PAT and Jira API tokens must be encrypted at rest, never logged, never in client payloads
- No per-developer performance framing — all anomalies are team/sprint-level
- Graceful degradation: show last cached state + error banner on API failure

## Planned integrations (not yet installed)

These are required by the PRD but not wired yet:
- Auth: NextAuth or Better Auth (FR-001, email + password)
- Database: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM via Neon or Supabase
- AI: `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, model `claude-haiku-4-5` (FR-020, Refinement Helper only)
- Email: Resend (FR-018, Daily Recap)
- Background jobs: node-cron or Cloudflare Cron Triggers (15-min sync loops)
- Cloudflare adapter: `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (Workers target; `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` is deprecated)
- Database driver: `@neondatabase/serverless` with `drizzle-orm/neon-http` (Workers require HTTP mode, not TCP)

## Task tracking conventions

Issue/PR work follows the hybrid convention in `context/foundation/task-tracking.md`. Read that file before creating, editing, or referencing GitHub issues. Highlights:

- **Roadmap IDs (`F-01`, `S-07`) are the stable identifier.** They live in `context/foundation/roadmap.md` and never change.
- **GitHub `#N` is secondary** — a clickable autolink, never a primary contract. Issues and PRs share one counter, so `#N` can't be predicted before creation.
- Issue body format (dependency sections): `**F-01** auth-provider-scaffold (#8) — description`.
- Parent tracker (#25) keeps bare `#N` first in checkboxes (`- [ ] #8 **F-01** …`) so GitHub auto-checks on close.
- **Never predict `#N` before an issue exists.** Always look it up via `gh issue list`.
- **Never delete an issue.** Edit, don't recreate — a recreated issue gets a new `#N` that breaks every prior reference.
- Scope changes start in `roadmap.md`, not in issue bodies. Roadmap is canonical; issues are instances.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 4

Prepare for a harder implementation stream with the **research-backed planning chain**:

```
internal research (/10x-research) + external research (exa.ai, Context7) -> /10x-plan -> /10x-implement -> success
```

The lesson focus is distinguishing internal from external research and using evidence to back planning decisions.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Internal research (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-research <change-id>` | You need evidence from the existing codebase — patterns, conventions, integration points, or existing implementations. Runs parallel sub-agents over the repo and writes structured findings to `research.md`. |
| **External research (lesson focus)** | |
| exa.ai | You need AI-native web search for library comparisons, best practices, or ecosystem context that the codebase cannot answer. |
| Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs`) | You need live, current documentation for a specific library or framework. Resolves a library ID first, then fetches relevant doc pages. |
| **Framing spare wheel** | |
| `/10x-frame <change-id>` | The plan won't converge, the plan doesn't deliver expected results, or persistent drift keeps breaking the implementation. Use as an escape hatch on a separate problem (demonstrated on Space Explorers example), not as pre-research ritual. |
| **Planning and execution** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` / `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | Use the same planning and execution chain from Lesson 2, now with upstream research evidence feeding the plan. |

### Research discipline

- Internal research (`/10x-research`) answers "what does our codebase already do?" — patterns, schemas, conventions, integration points.
- External research (exa.ai, Context7) answers "what should we do?" — library capabilities, API docs, ecosystem best practices.
- Combine both as evidence-backed input to `/10x-plan`. A plan without research evidence on a non-trivial stream is a guess.
- Agent-friendly docs (`llms.txt`, markdown-for-agents, `/md` endpoints) are a quality signal for library selection — libraries that publish agent-readable docs integrate faster.

### `/10x-frame` as spare wheel

Three triggers for reaching for `/10x-frame`:
1. The plan won't converge — research keeps opening more questions instead of narrowing to a contract.
2. The plan doesn't deliver — implementation repeatedly fails to meet success criteria.
3. Persistent drift — the implementation keeps diverging from the plan in ways that suggest the problem was mis-framed.

Demonstrated on a Space Explorers example, not the SRS path. It is an escape hatch, not a mandatory step.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/research.md` - internal research output
- `context/changes/<change-id>/frame.md` - framing output when needed
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - evidence-backed implementation contract
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
